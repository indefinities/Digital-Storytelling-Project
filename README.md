# Digital Storytelling Project
During spring semester of freshman year, once I returned from N.U.in Canada, I participated in two hackathons: *Hack@Brown* and *TechTogether Boston*. During these hackathons and through taking 5D tools, I was able to learn a lot oabout **HTML and CSS** at an accelerated pace and wanted to demonstrate my skills through constructing a website displaying all my accomplishments during the semester.
