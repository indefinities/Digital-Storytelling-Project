# Digital Storytelling Project
During spring semester of freshman year, once I returned from N.U.in Canada, I participated in two hackathons: __Hack@Brown__ and __TechTogether Boston__. During these hackathons and through taking 5D tools, I was able to learn a lot oabout HTML and CSS at an accelerated pace and wanted to demonstrate my skills through constructing a website displaying all my accomplishments during the semester.
