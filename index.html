            <p id="resume-text">During CS1200, we looked through potential mock internships and created a
                resume listing our achievements and skills and wrote a cover letter based off
                of the internship that we found online. I found this assignment useful since
                I learned that employers actually only scan your resume for about a minute
                before moving onto someone else's resume. In addition, I was also able to
                obtain feedback from my peers regarding how to better present myself to
                employers from the PowerPoint presentation shown in class.

            Khoury held a welcome reception for new incoming computer science students.</p>
