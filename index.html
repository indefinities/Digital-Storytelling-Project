            <h3 class="header">Resume + Cover Letter</h3>
            <img class="left-img" src="images/cs1200/resume builder.png" />
            <p class="resume-text">During CS1200, we looked through potential mock internships and created a
                resume listing our achievements and skills and wrote a cover letter based off
                of the internship that we found online. I found this assignment useful since
                I learned that employers actually only scan your resume for about a minute
                before moving onto someone else's resume. In addition, I was also able to
                obtain feedback from my peers regarding how to better present myself to
                employers from the PowerPoint presentation shown in class. I was also reassured
                that it is never too early to be looking for potential jobs and internships.

            <h3 class="header">Time Management + Prioritization</h3>
            <img class="right-img" src="images/cs1200/time management.png"/>
            <p class="resume-text">When starting freshman year, I had a lot of trouble managing my time
                between friends, family, and schoolwork. Even though I still have a lot of trouble with this 
                now, I believe the Time Management assignment we did in class is useful since it allowed me to
                get in the habit of reading through the syllabus for each of my classes and seeing what is due 
                when so I can prioritize accordingly. Not only did I figure out how many hours I spend on each activity
                throughout my day, but it also allowed me to update my Google Calendar accordingly so I would know
                when to switch from one activity to another.
