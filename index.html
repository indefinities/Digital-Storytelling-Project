    <!-- At least THREE lessons I've learned from CS1200 that
I found meaningful from class and why, from class material. -->


    <div id="cs1200-lessons">

        <h2 class="header section-header">CS1200: What did I learn from this class?</h2>

        <div class="cs1200-section">
            <h3 class="header">Resume + Cover Letter</h3>
            <img class="left-img" src="images/cs1200/resume builder.png" />
            <p>During CS1200, we looked through potential mock internships and created a
                resume listing our achievements and skills and wrote a cover letter based off
                of the internship that we found online. I found this assignment useful since
                I learned that employers actually only scan your resume for about a minute
                before moving onto someone else's resume. In addition, I was also able to
                obtain feedback from my peers regarding how to better present myself to
                employers from the PowerPoint presentation shown in class. I was also reassured
                that it is never too early to be looking for potential jobs and internships.

        <div class="cs1200-section">
            <h3 class="header">Time Management + Prioritization</h3>
            <img class="right-img" src="images/cs1200/time management.png" />
            <p>When starting freshman year, I had a lot of trouble managing my time
                between friends, family, and schoolwork. Even though I still have a lot of trouble with this
                now, I believe the Time Management assignment we did in class is useful since it allowed me to
                get in the habit of reading through the syllabus for each of my classes and seeing what is due
                when so I can prioritize accordingly. Not only did I figure out how many hours I spend on each activity
                throughout my day, but it also allowed me to update my Google Calendar accordingly so I would know
                when to switch from one activity to another.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cs1200-section">
            <h3 class="header">Failure, Creativity, + Design Thinking</h3>
            <img class="center-img"
                src="https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/uploaded_images/Rg8cEaySKvajFTShkFgdEidapz48jklQdXE7Nzfe.png" />
            <p>
                Even though this was a recent topic we learned about in class, I believe this is one of the most
                meaningful concepts we covered since design thinking can really be applied in the past, present, and
                future.
                Furthermore, since I am a Computer Science and Design major, many of my classes involve learning about
                specific step-by-step approaches to projects using design thinking. Design thinmking involves the past
                through
                taking into account what did not work out for your project, the present through what the creator can
                implement
                now, and the future through describing what goals the creator has for their project in the future.

            <p>When I first came to Northeastern, I really wanted to join a
                computer science-related club. During the first few weeks of January,
                Khoury held a welcome reception for new incoming computer science students.
                I looked around the room and NUHacks caught my attention. I went to the first
                meeting and found a new home here at Northeastern. I became inspired to learn
                more about computer science while also having a place I can go to every
                Thrusday to talk about Fundies and hang out with cool people.

                TechTogether was the second hackathon that I attended. I heard about this
                hackathon through an email that Khoury sent me. I attended the hackathon with
                my roommate and one of our friends from N.U.in Canada. At first it was difficult
                to figure out a project idea since all of our team members had different skill assets,
                but as we continued to think, we came up with an idea that involved front-end and back-end.
                In conclusion, I learned about better teamwork and more about HTML and CSS at this event.

                Asian Student Union is a club which advocates for Asian American
                students at Northeastern. I joined this club because, as a student
                of Taiwanese-American descent, I wanted to find a club where I could share my experiences
                and relate to other Asian-Americans on campus. Here, I participated in many activities
                involving various Asian activities, as ASU has coordinated with Chinese Student Association,
                Korean American Student Association, Hawai'i Ohana, ΒΧΘ, and more. At this club, I learned
                to embrace my identity as an Asian American while also participating in fun, culture-filled 
                events and general meetings. I enjoyed this club so much that I am now the Media Specialist 
                of their E-Board.

        <h4>Try new things. Get out of your comfort zone. Manage your time well.</h4>
        <p>
            Aside from CO-OP, Northeastern has a lot to offer when it comes to school
            life as well. Take every opportunity to make new friends and try things that 
            you wouldn't have in high school; college is the place where you can truly find
            where you belong in the world. Also, don't forget to use your meal swipes, 
            sometimes not eating can become a habit (╯•﹏•╰).
